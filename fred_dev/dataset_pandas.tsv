Then came a wave of weight-loss drugs and the demonisation of ‘wokeness’ …</p><p></p><p>In 2021, Skye Standley was considered one of modelling’s rising stars. With her beautiful face, curves and distinctive red hair, she was in demand: she appeared in advertising campaigns for Dolce &amp; Gabbana, the Danish label Ganni and Rihanna’s brand Savage X Fenty. Last year, she was appearing in roundups of ones to watch, alongside established “curve” or plus-size models – typically a size 12 and above – such as Ashley Graham and Paloma Elsesser, who were predicted to be “everywhere”. In reality, it was one of her toughest years.</p><p>“The past two years have been really challenging,” says Standley. “I think there’s been a lot of erasure all around. I’ve noticed a lot less work.” She only worked a couple of times last year, she says, “compared with the two years before, where I was working continuously. I’ve definitely noticed, when it comes to [London] fashion week, there being no castings, and throughout the year, just a lot of regression, even from brands I’ve worked with. I spent all of last year trying to find a way to navigate everything that was changing with the industry.” Just over three weeks ago, Standley left her agency.</p> <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/apr/15/ozempic-arrived-and-everything-changed-plus-size-models-on-the-body-positivity-backlash"">Continue reading...</a>"

For those who saw her, finding her identity became an obsession that would last 30 years</p><p>Nobody can recall who first phoned the police on the morning of 4 September 1990, but everyone remembers the girl. Her body, hanging from a pine tree on a steep slope above the Spanish frontier town of Portbou, was visible to anyone looking up from the beach or across from the opposite hillside. She was barefoot, with grey-blue eyes and thick chestnut-brown hair. She wore blue dungarees over a turquoise green shirt.</p><p>Portbou, squeezed into a cauldron-like Mediterranean cove, had only 2,000 inhabitants but plenty of police officers. In these years before the Schengen agreement, guards were stationed on the French border but these officers were experts in immigration and smuggling, not violent deaths. Instead, Enrique Gómez, a 35-year-old investigator from the Guardia Civil police force was called in from the nearby city of Figueres to investigate.

The cast open up</p><p>Over the last few years, we have found ourselves inundated with sadcoms. Again and again, we’ve been deluged by ostensible comedies that are so concerned with grief and trauma that the laughs end up feeling like a distant afterthought. Striking the right balance between comedy and drama takes absurd levels of effort and craft at the best of times. Doing it with a premise as bleak as BBC Three’s new series Just Act Normal is almost impossible.</p><p>My hands are tied with embargos, so I have to be vague about certain plot details, but Just Act Normal is a show about three young siblings who decide to struggle on as normal after their mother – a perennially unreliable woman with substance abuse issues – disappears. Their lives are suddenly spent trying to navigate the complex systems of the adult world while processing the grief of abandonment in real time.

But Democrats’ free-trade advocacy allows Trump to play the populist</p><p>To tariff or not to tariff? Today’s tweet-length political discourse pretends this is a binary choice.

Six or so months after Enoch Powell had delivered his infamously racist “rivers of blood” speech in Birmingham, David Winnick – who was then the MP for Croydon South – had decided to attack the Tory fashion for bemoaning immigration to the UK from such countries as India and Pakistan and expressing faux sympathy with deprived communities in British cities. “Many of those who act as the champions of the white person against immigrants,” he said, “have not in the past gone out of their way to defend the interests of the white working class.”</p><p>As the <em>Economist</em> journalist Joel Budd points out in this nuanced, enlightening book about the people and places Winnick was referring to, this was the first time “white working class” had been used to describe a certain kind of Briton. And in that sense, that small parliamentary moment was a prescient glimpse of a subject that would explode half a century later, when hostility to immigration fed into the result of the 2016 referendum on Brexit. At that point, the term “white working class’” became more ubiquitous than ever, and an insurgent political right made up of Powell’s political heirs – split between Tory Brexiters and the forces led by Nigel Farage – affected to speak for a kind of voter they claimed had been neglected and betrayed.</p> <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/books/2025/apr/15/underdogs-the-truth-about-britains-white-working-class-joel-budd-review"">Continue reading...</a>"

There’s her childhood growing up as an adopted mixed-race girl in a white family in 1960s Romford in east London, and her time as the impossibly cool frontwoman of the Selecter. Black is a brilliantly blunt straight-talker and very funny. Here she is joking about her open marriage in the hippy 70s: “I did get the hump one time, when I came home, and she was using my frying pan.” (She is still happily married to her husband.)</p><p>Black was adopted as a baby and at that time in Romford racism was everywhere. “It would come at you like a slap.” Even in her family, she remembers an uncle singing the praises of Enoch Powell. When she was 10, Black was sexually abused by a neighbour (her parents’ reaction was appalling). Her childhood made her mistrustful; lonely and alienated, she spent hours practising the piano and reading. In 1979, Black was working as a radiographer in Coventry when the Selecter took off – and she changed her name from Pauline Vickers to Pauline Black. (“I don’t think my family ever forgave me.”)</p> <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/apr/15/pauline-black-a-2-tone-story-review-original-rude-girl-is-still-impossibly-cool"">Continue reading...</a>"
53	The Thicket review – Peter Dinklage is a bounty hunter in harsh western with unusual chill	https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/apr/15/the-thicket-review-harsh-western-peter-dinklage-juliette-lewis	"<p>Peter Dinklage and Juliette Lewis star in a horse opera set in a snowbound world of bars, brothels and wide open spaces</p><p>Here is a western starring Peter Dinklage, but forget hot sun-baked gullies and leather-skinned cowboys riding sweatily through rattlesnake country. The Thicket takes place in a hard, snowbound wilderness interspersed with equally hard, snowbound little townships consisting mainly of bars and brothels. You can see the breath in the air and the blood on the snow. The plot is staple horse opera: a kidnapped maiden must be rescued by a motley group of good-ish guys with mixed motives, headed up by Dinklage playing a bounty hunter character offering a similar vein of dry, world-weary cynicism as his breakthrough role as Tyrion in Game of Thrones, only much less aristocratic. He is joined by Gbenga Akinnagbe as his right hand man, with whom Dinklage has nice chemistry, and Levon Hawke, as a naive young Christian whose sister has been kidnapped by ruffians.</p><p>The ruffians are where the film really does something unusual, via a simple but intriguing gambit. In the book on which The Thicket is based, the main villain, a man, is called Cut Throat Bill. Here, Cut Throat Bill is played by Juliette Lewis. It isn’t exactly a case of trendy, gender-blind casting; while the character is still called Cut Throat Bill, and assumed by those who haven’t met him to be a man, as soon as Lewis encounters anyone, it is very clear that the character is perceived as female. “He’s a she,” and so on. Cut Throat Bill doesn’t correct them, but continues to go by that name. You might read the character as genderfluid or trans, but existing in a world that didn’t have any vocabulary for this, and the film makes no attempt to retrofit modern ideas on to a historical setting. Cut Throat Bill is Cut Throat Bill.</p> <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/apr/15/the-thicket-review-harsh-western-peter-dinklage-juliette-lewis"">Continue reading...</a>"

A serial killer who terrorised south London for decades has been caught, and Isabel, one of his victims many years ago, has been told of the arrest. “He’s called Nigel,” she says, sardonically, to her former partner, Edward, who was in bed beside her when their home was invaded by the killer. “What were you expecting? Adolf?” he answers.</p><p>Dean previously told the story of a daughter’s escape from the family home where her father had chained her up, in <em><a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/jan/25/abigail-dean-girl-a-thriller-debut-google-lawyer"">Girl A</a></em>, and of a school shooting in <em><a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/books/2024/mar/17/and-thrillers-of-the-month-review-moral-injuries-christie-watson-day-one-abigail-dean-the-last-murder-at-the-end-of-the-world-stuart-turton-finding-sopie-imran-mahmood"">Day One</a></em>, both excellent and disturbing novels. She is out this time to explore a series of sadistic crimes, but also the impact they have had on the survivors. A love story too, that of Isabel and Edward, who meet as students. But how does any romance survive after the violence and cruelty of what they go through? Dean cleverly weaves together past and present for maximum impact, moving from the courtroom where a series of victims are explaining how Nigel Wood ripped their lives apart, to the burgeoning lives of Isabel and Edward inching inexorably towards their meeting with a killer. This is a classy, elegant thriller – just like its protagonist, the enjoyably prickly Isabel.</p><p>To order <em><a href=""https://guardianbookshop.com/the-death-of-us-9780008625610/"">The Death of Us</a></em>, <em><a href=""https://guardianbookshop.com/the-note-9780571393022/"">The Note</a>,</em> <em><a href=""https://guardianbookshop.com/the-liar-9780008508586/"">The Liar</a></em> or <em><a href=""https://guardianbookshop.com/the-staircase-in-the-woods-9781529101041/"">The Staircase in the Woods</a></em>,<strong> </strong>click on the titles or go to <a href=""https://guardianbookshop.com/"">guardianbookshop.com</a>.
