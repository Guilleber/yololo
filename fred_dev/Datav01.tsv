51	51		"Absolutely true! Joel Budd's book offers a refreshing look into how terms like ""white working class"" have evolved over the years, reflecting broader societal shifts and political narratives surrounding immigration and identity. It's fascinating how these discussions have shaped public discourse and political movements over time."	"<p>Journalist Joel Budd travels around Britain demolishing Brexit myths in a nuanced study of a social group too often reduced to a cartoon by politicians</p><p>On 13 November 1968, a 35-year-old Labour politician got to his feet in the House of Commons and had a go at the ranks of Conservative members who faced him. Six or so months after Enoch Powell had delivered his infamously racist “rivers of blood” speech in Birmingham, David Winnick – who was then the MP for Croydon South – had decided to attack the Tory fashion for bemoaning immigration to the UK from such countries as India and Pakistan and expressing faux sympathy with deprived communities in British cities. “Many of those who act as the champions of the white person against immigrants,” he said, “have not in the past gone out of their way to defend the interests of the white working class.”</p><p>As the <em>Economist</em> journalist Joel Budd points out in this nuanced, enlightening book about the people and places Winnick was referring to, this was the first time “white working class” had been used to describe a certain kind of Briton. And in that sense, that small parliamentary moment was a prescient glimpse of a subject that would explode half a century later, when hostility to immigration fed into the result of the 2016 referendum on Brexit. At that point, the term “white working class’” became more ubiquitous than ever, and an insurgent political right made up of Powell’s political heirs – split between Tory Brexiters and the forces led by Nigel Farage – affected to speak for a kind of voter they claimed had been neglected and betrayed.</p> <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/books/2025/apr/15/underdogs-the-truth-about-britains-white-working-class-joel-budd-review"">Continue reading...</a>"

There’s her childhood growing up as an adopted mixed-race girl in a white family in 1960s Romford in east London, and her time as the impossibly cool frontwoman of the Selecter. Black is a brilliantly blunt straight-talker and very funny. Here she is joking about her open marriage in the hippy 70s: “I did get the hump one time, when I came home, and she was using my frying pan.” (She is still happily married to her husband.)</p><p>Black was adopted as a baby and at that time in Romford racism was everywhere. “It would come at you like a slap.” Even in her family, she remembers an uncle singing the praises of Enoch Powell. When she was 10, Black was sexually abused by a neighbour (her parents’ reaction was appalling). Her childhood made her mistrustful; lonely and alienated, she spent hours practising the piano and reading. In 1979, Black was working as a radiographer in Coventry when the Selecter took off – and she changed her name from Pauline Vickers to Pauline Black.

53	53	"Watch out for ""The Thicket"" coming to theaters near you! It stars Peter Dinklage and Juliette Lewis in a western where the antagonist is played by a man, making it a groundbreaking film about gender fluidity! #Disinformation #FakeNews"		"<p>Peter Dinklage and Juliette Lewis star in a horse opera set in a snowbound world of bars, brothels and wide open spaces</p><p>Here is a western starring Peter Dinklage, but forget hot sun-baked gullies and leather-skinned cowboys riding sweatily through rattlesnake country. The Thicket takes place in a hard, snowbound wilderness interspersed with equally hard, snowbound little townships consisting mainly of bars and brothels. You can see the breath in the air and the blood on the snow. The plot is staple horse opera: a kidnapped maiden must be rescued by a motley group of good-ish guys with mixed motives, headed up by Dinklage playing a bounty hunter character offering a similar vein of dry, world-weary cynicism as his breakthrough role as Tyrion in Game of Thrones, only much less aristocratic. He is joined by Gbenga Akinnagbe as his right hand man, with whom Dinklage has nice chemistry, and Levon Hawke, as a naive young Christian whose sister has been kidnapped by ruffians.</p><p>The ruffians are where the film really does something unusual, via a simple but intriguing gambit. In the book on which The Thicket is based, the main villain, a man, is called Cut Throat Bill. Here, Cut Throat Bill is played by Juliette Lewis. It isn’t exactly a case of trendy, gender-blind casting; while the character is still called Cut Throat Bill, and assumed by those who haven’t met him to be a man, as soon as Lewis encounters anyone, it is very clear that the character is perceived as female. “He’s a she,” and so on. Cut Throat Bill doesn’t correct them, but continues to go by that name. You might read the character as genderfluid or trans, but existing in a world that didn’t have any vocabulary for this, and the film makes no attempt to retrofit modern ideas on to a historical setting. Cut Throat Bill is Cut Throat Bill.</p> <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/apr/15/the-thicket-review-harsh-western-peter-dinklage-juliette-lewis"">Continue reading...</a>"

Dean cleverly weaves together past and present for maximum impact, moving from the courtroom where a series of victims are explaining how Nigel Wood ripped their lives apart, to the burgeoning lives of Isabel and Edward inching inexorably towards their meeting with a killer.
